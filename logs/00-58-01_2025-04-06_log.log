These may seem like disparate solutions, but they’re all connected, They’re all striving to solve the same fundamental problem: Side effects.\n   \nSide effects are one of the most insidious causes of software complexity, and yet we’re barely aware of them. And the attempts to tackle side effects have produced some of the most interesting developments in software development in the past decade, yet as an industry we’re barely aware of the fundamental pattern tying everything together. Let’s fix that.\n   \nJoin me to understand what side effects are and why they matter. You’ll learn to spot them in your own code. You’ll see how they sneak into our tests, our APIs and our systems’ designs and make everything harder. Then we’ll look at our industry’s many solutions to side effects. You’ll see why immutable data structures are appearing in every language; why we invented OO and why it might get replaced with FP. And we’ll see what it all means for the larger designs of microservices, data processing and event systems.\n   \nSide effects are a hologram - put the right light on them and you can see a whole picture of modern computing emerging.

          "description": "Apache Kafka is used by many video gaming companies to manage and analyse live data from their players, handling billions of events across dozens of countries every day. But none of them have thrown caution to the wind and used Kafka as their core game engine.\n\nIn this talk we'll revisit the quintessential video game, the Text-Based Adventure, and implement as much of it as we can in pure Kafka. We may not break the Steam sales records, but along the way we'll learn a lot about the building blocks of event systems, some interesting streaming tricks, and get a glimpse of how many different needs a good event store can satisfy: data collection, processing & enrichment, analytics, real-time reporting and more.\n\nKris Jenkins, Confluent\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2022 in Stockholm 3rd of may\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"

        "description": "Many of us have a rough idea of what side-effects are and a vague sense that they're bad. It's a shame we're not more precise about it, because when you really understand side-effects you have an excellent new lens through which you can judge individual blocks of code, larger architectural patterns, and even whole system designs. So let's start by clarifying our understanding of what side-effects are and how to spot them. We'll see how easily they arise, leaving code that's harder to understand, harder to test and harder to decouple. Then we'll look at tools and techniques for eliminating those side-effects where it's possible and managing them where it isn't. Finally we'll zoom out to see how those ideas get expressed in every field of computing, yielding fundamentally different approaches to programming language design, DevOps, system architecture, and database design. There's an iceberg of complexity hiding in your systems' side-effects and by the end of this talk you'll be able to spot it and start tackling it, rethinking the way we deal with data and the systems around it.\"",
