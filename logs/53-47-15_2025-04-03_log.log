        "description": "What will save us from software complexity? Microservices architectures? Immutable data? Functional languages? Event streaming? These may seem like disparate solutions, but they’re all connected, They’re all striving to solve the same fundamental problem: Side effects.\n   \nSide effects are one of the most insidious causes of software complexity, and yet we’re barely aware of them. And the attempts to tackle side effects have produced some of the most interesting developments in software development in the past decade, yet as an industry we’re barely aware of the fundamental pattern tying everything together. Let’s fix that.\n   \nJoin me to understand what side effects are and why they matter. You’ll learn to spot them in your own code. You’ll see how they sneak into our tests, our APIs and our systems’ designs and make everything harder. Then we’ll look at our industry’s many solutions to side effects. You’ll see why immutable data structures are appearing in every language; why we invented OO and why it might get replaced with FP. And we’ll see what it all means for the larger designs of microservices, data processing and event systems.\n   \nSide effects are a hologram - put the right light on them and you can see a whole picture of modern computing emerging. Take a look and you’ll see the nice things the future could hold.\n\nABOUT CONFLUENT\nConfluent is pioneering a fundamentally new category of data infrastructure focused on data in motion.

Let's find out.\nIn this live-coding session we'll build a real-time dashboard from scratch. Dancing across three languages - KSQL, Python and JavaScript - we'll piece together the skeleton of a dashboard that could serve KPIs to everyone in your organisation, or just form the basis of your next lunchtime hacking session [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:58 Startup life\n02:30 Demo/Live-coding\n35:19 Conclusion\n37:34 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2021/sessions/1988/dashing-off-a-dashboard\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMaryann Kisamore • Basics Of Apache Kafka • https://amzn.to/3tkVYFD\nMitch Seymour • Mastering Kafka Streams and ksqlDB • https://amzn.to/3HZ18wK\nTed Dunning & Ellen Friedman • Streaming Architecture • https://amzn.to/3lhk3Kb\nLiz Rice • Container Security • https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe\nNeal Ford • Functional Thinking • https://amzn.to/3DdP35B\nPetricek & Skeet • Real-World Functional Programming • https://amzn.to/38diF4M\nVenkat Subramaniam • Functional Programming in Java • https://amzn.to/2WlOXIt\nNaomi Ceder • The Quick Python Book • https://amzn.to/3zwdDOa\nLuciano Ramalho • Fluent Python • https://amzn.to/3oSw2je\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Kafka #ApacheKafka #KSQL #KSQLDM #Python #JavaScript #JS #LiveCoding #Demo #KrisJenkins #EventStream #JSON #WebSockets #Confluent #React #ReactJS #LiveHack #Hacking\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

        "description": "Many of us have a rough idea of what side-effects are and a vague sense that they're bad. It's a shame we're not more precise about it, because when you really understand side-effects you have an excellent new lens through which you can judge individual blocks of code, larger architectural patterns, and even whole system designs. So let's start by clarifying our understanding of what side-effects are and how to spot them. We'll see how easily they arise, leaving code that's harder to understand, harder to test and harder to decouple. Then we'll look at tools and techniques for eliminating those side-effects where it's possible and managing them where it isn't. Finally we'll zoom out to see how those ideas get expressed in every field of computing, yielding fundamentally different approaches to programming language design, DevOps, system architecture, and database design. There's an iceberg of complexity hiding in your systems' side-effects and by the end of this talk you'll be able to spot it and start tackling it, rethinking the way we deal with data and the systems around it.\"",

        "description": "Modern type systems have come a long way from the days of C and Java. Far from being nit-pickers that berate us for making mistakes, type systems like the ones found in Haskell, PureScript and Elm form a language in themselves. A language for expressing high-level ideas about our software to our colleagues and to the computer. A design language. In this talk, we'll take a look at the way the right kind of type signatures let us talk about software. We'll survey how to state our assumptions about the domain we're coding in and how each part fits together. We'll show how it can highlight problems, and surface opportunities for reuse. And most importantly, we'll see how types can help you communicate to your coworkers, and to future maintainers, with little effort. You've probably heard the phrase, \"programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute.\" Come and see how a modern type system is about communicating ideas to humans, and only incidentally about proving correctness.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev",

The frontend, backend and database must all agree on a data-model, and if they don't, the system crashes spectacularly.\n\nThe default solutions are either to invest heavily in hand-written integration tests, or use JavaScript everywhere. Neither of these are ideal. However there is a compelling alternative - use the same types everywhere.\n\nBy reusing strong, static types across tiers, we can make guarantees about the consistency of the entire system, and dramatically lower the cost of change.\n\nWe present one approach that uses Haskell data types to drive a both a PostgreSQL database schema and a frontend system written in Elm.
